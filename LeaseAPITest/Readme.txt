I made this project using REST Assured library in Java.

I made 4 different files:
- LeasePlanAPITests - file that contains main API tests;
- payLoad - list of body requests for POST methods;
- resources - list of POST, GET resources;
- env.properties - list of main properties, general for test methods.
